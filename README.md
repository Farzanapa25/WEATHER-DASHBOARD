# Task Description:

 As part of the internship, we were assigned to build a Weather Dashboard web application using React.js. The main objective was to fetch and display real-time weather information based on user input, integrating with a public API (OpenWeatherMap).

This application allows users to:

-Enter any city name manually.

-View the current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing weather conditions.

-View a 5-day weather forecast (excluding today), with separate weather cards showing date, temperature, humidity, and forecast icons.

The UI is designed to be:

-User-friendly and responsive, using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

-Visually appealing with gradient headers, white backgrounds, and modern card layouts for weather data.

# Technologies Used:
-React JS for frontend component development

-OpenWeatherMap API for live weather and forecast data

-Bootstrap 5 for layout and styling

-CSS3 for custom design and responsiveness

# Deliverables:
-A fully working React application.

-Proper folder structure with clean code.

-Hosted or demo-ready version if needed.

# OUTPUT:
